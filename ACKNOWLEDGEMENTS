The author, John C. Bowman, expresses his gratitude to two people for very
significant contributions to this project.  The philosophy of a generic
integration package for initial value problems that underlies TRIAD (and in
fact much of its overall "look and feel") was greatly influenced by the
ideas of John A. Krommes, who conceived of, and developed in conjunction
with the author, the turbulence code DIA in the 1980's and early 1990's.
In fact, TRIAD grew out of the desire to implement an object-oriented version
of a portion of the DIA code.  The author also gratefully acknowledges
B. A. Shadwick for his fundamental role in 1994 in the initial design of
the key kernel, parameter, and integration classes of TRIAD.
